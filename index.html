		<p>If you throw a cobble, it falls to the ground obviously. How about throwing it with different speed? If you want to throw it further to win your friends, what you will do?</p>
		<p>Try the interactive graph below to observe the relationship between velocity and distance.</p>
		<div id='viz1'>	
		</div>
		<div class='control'>
			<button type='button' id='start'>Start</button>
			<span>Adjust Velocity:</span>
			<div id='slider1'>	
			</div>			
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class='content'>
		<p>You may notice that with a higher velocity, the cobble will go further.</p>
		<p>If this cobble has an extraordinary speed, will it still fall back to the ground? If not, where it goes?</p>
		<p>Try the interactive graph below to see the moving pattern of the object under different velocity.</p>
		<div id='viz2'>

		<div class='control'>
			<button type='button' id='rotate'>Start</button>

		<p>When the speed reaches 7.9km/s, the object will not fall back to Earth. Instead, it orbits around the Earth. This speed is called the first cosmic velocity. This speed is reached when the object gets just enough speed to orbit around the central planet.</p>
		<p>When the speed is greater than 11.2km/s, the object will escape from the Earth. Because the object has enough energy to conqure the gravity of the Earth. This speed is called the second cosmic velocity, which is the speed that the object can just about to escape from the central planet.</p>
	</div>

	<div class='content'>
		<p>On different planet, due to its mass, the object has different first and second cosmic velocity.</p>
		<p>The mass of Jupiter is larger than that of Earth. The mass of Mars is the least.</p>
		<p>Try the interactive graph below to see the moving pattern of the object around different planet.</p>

		<p>Jupiter has both the largest first and second cosmic velocity. Jupiter also has the largest mass. The object around the Jupiter has to gain a higher speed to conqure the gravity so that it can orbit around or escape from the central planet.</p>
